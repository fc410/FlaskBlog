This was an overall tough assignment for me. It was a challenge trying to finish the milestone and I enjoyed it all the way through because
it got me out of my comfort zone and made me do some research on python and flask. This was my first time learning python and I honestly 
loved it, I see it as a more simplistic version of c++ in the sense that there is not a lot of syntax like semicolons. The first struggle I
had on this assignment was getting familarized with python programming so I watched a few videos and did some reading then I familiarized 
myself with flask. The last struggle was trying to find out a way to edit a specific web page I spent hours trying to find a way and 
unfortunately was not able to complete that part of this assignment. My advice to future students would be to go to every class because I 
missed the second day of class and as a result I had to do some research on the things I missed and put me really behind, and to just do
reaserch on the libraries that they will be using so that the overall process of the assignments can be easier. Missing that second day of class really but me behind and was going to seek help by metting with you but I decided to try and figure out how flask worked by myself and did a lot of reading and watched some videos that helped out a lot. The part that was most fun was running the project and seeing the web pages that I built because I have never done this before but have always wanted to learn. Thanks to this assignment I have decided to do more research on web design to hopefully be able to build my own website of some sort in the future. One suggestion that I would make would be to maybe go over the flask library a little more before letting us do our own thing, and since this was my first time learning this programming language I could have benefited on learning the basics first before tackling this assignment.
